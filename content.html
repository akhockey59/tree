            <p>A Tree is a non-linear data structure and a hierarchy consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).</p>

            <h2>1. Binary Tree</h2>
            <p>A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children referred to as the left child and the right child.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each node has at most two children.</li>
                <li>The tree is typically organized into levels or layers.</li>
                <li>Binary trees are used for searching, sorting, and hierarchical data storage.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Example:</b></p>
            <p>Consider the tree below. Each node has only 2 children, making it a Binary Tree.</p>
